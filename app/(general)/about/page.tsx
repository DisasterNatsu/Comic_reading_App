          </h2>
          <p className="md:text-left text-center">
            The Disaster Scans started first as an Youtube channel, with the
            first ever series Natsu, the former group leader picked up is
            Apotheosis and with support of our readers and with Natsu's love for
            manhua we picked up more serieses. However, finally The Disaster
            Scans moved away from YouTube.

            The Journey
          </h2>
          <p className="md:text-left text-center">
            The domain disasterscans.com along with hosting was first purchased
            by a reader named KMA, and now he is a key member of this group.
            Along the way we suffered many hardships and through all the trials
            and tribulations we still survived with the support of our readers
            and hopefully, we will continue to provide quality releases for our
            readers.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3 md:text-left text-center">
            Thank you for supporting us... we couldn't have been able to do it
            without the support from all our readers.
          </p>
